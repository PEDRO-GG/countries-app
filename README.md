This app allows users to learn about countries around the world. Here is a link to the site: https://countriesexplorer.netlify.app/

## Additonal Info
This is my solution to the following Fronted Mentor Challenge: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca. Frontend Mentor provided me with the design files and my job was to make this website as close as possible to the design.

The rest api used to complete this project is: https://restcountries.eu/
